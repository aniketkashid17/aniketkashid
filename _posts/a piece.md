An incident that made me reflect and lose focus occurred during my trip to Varanasi with two friends on the Kamayani Express, specifically in the segment between Manmad and an unknown destination. A family of five, likely boarded from Manmad Junction, entered the train and settled across the floor in front of our berth, a common practice for non-reserved passengers in Indian Railways.

The family comprised a girl, two boys, an elderly lady (possibly a grandmother), and a single mother. They appeared impoverished, adorned with cheap, peculiar metal jewelry, barefoot, and heavily pierced. The children, seemingly without a father, looked as if they had experienced hardship, wearing ragged clothes resembling those who might have worked in a coal mine.

The girl, with her naturally ochre-colored messy hair and poverty-stricken brown eyes, captured my undivided attention, reflecting both pain and innocence.

Out of nowhere, a person aged 55-60 inquired about the children's academic pursuits, receiving the obvious answer that they were not engaged in any. This person then expressed his views on the necessity of securing the future of these kids, appearing to be a well-intentioned individual.

Meanwhile, a young boy from the family sat in a small space next to my friend, who was engrossed in reading "The Idiot." The boy exclaimed, "bhaiya apki capy badiya hai!" appreciating the book. Disturbed by the interaction, my friend delved into deep thought. When asked, he revealed feeling ashamed to read in front of them.

The girl stood up and sat next to the aforementioned "good man." However, to my surprise, the man displayed visible disgust, promptly shooing her back to the floor of the compartment. This prompted me to question how a person could behave so contradictorily to his previous beliefs. The underlying factor seemed to be their destitution; poverty is not virtuous, and this observation sparked my contemplation on whether the pain and suffering I perceived were accurate judgments or a misconception.

The second option, that they might be content with their situation, was dismissed in my thoughts. No sane person would choose such a life unless they had attained a philosophical understanding of their circumstances.

In conclusion, I believe one should not bring lives into this world unless they are capable and immune to its challenges in every possible way. The generational development of this family has led to disarray and a decline in emotional well-being.
