# Hello World!
This is my first post on this blog.


## What should you expect from this blog?
Blogs in the future may be related to Tech, Philosophy, Enterpreneurship and Finance, Science, Books.
This blog is an attempt to make learning rewarding for others.
It is also partly my scratchpad to note thoughts and ideas.

#### Tech and Computer
I started quite late in computers, around the month of sept 2022. I instantly fell in love with it. 
I am quite curious about both the hardware and software parts of computer, roughly 73% software and 27% hardware.
Blogs realted to various techs are underway!

#### Philosophy
I started reading and understanding philosophy around 11th grade. My outlook of it is purely practical.
"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius" was the first text which had struck chord in me about this. Marcus Aurelius, Seneca 
and many more have special place in my brain. My modern day thoughts co-incides wiht Jordan Peterson.
Currently I am exploring a Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky through his Philosphical fictionals like Brothers of Karamazov,
Crime and punishments.
If interested read a short story of "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".

#### Enterpreneurship and Finance
Finance is interesting because firstly it affects each and everyone, secondly it has intersection with maths, peoples's sentiment,
maths, CS, and politics. If you have interesting idea to develop, you are more than welcome to discuss.
