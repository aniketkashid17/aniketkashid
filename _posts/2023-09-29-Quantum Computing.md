Let's dive into Quantum Mania.

# What is Quantum computing ?

Computers were invented to solve complex mathematical problems which were solved by humans with pen and paper which was quite a breath taking task. So let us imagine we live in a mathematical world, where moving around is equivalent to solving math problems. So first when humans were solving problems on there own with pen and paper, we were moving in the math world on our own legs. When early computers were invented we started horse riding (believe me these early computers were like a blue whale! f huge). And when modern computers came into play we started moving around in a car.

Obviously, now everyone will think that using quantum computers will be like using a super car (certainly not DC Avanti, its not a super car!) or a Jet. But wait, Quantum computers are not that. Its the biggest misconception that people have about quantum computing, it is though faster than our traditional computers but only in certain fields of mathematics.

You can consider quantum computers as a boat. Therefore boats arenâ€™t necessarily faster than cars but, they are made for different terrain, which in our case is to discover different undiscovered area of the math world.

### How does a Quantum computer works ?

For understanding this, first we need to understand how does our traditional computers work.

In traditional computers all the mathematical operations are done using logic gates such as AND, NOT, OR gates and their combinations. To perform these operations we use transistors, consider transistors as a valve(faucet) on a water pipeline, where water acts as current. When the valve is open water can flow hence 1 and when the valve is closed it is 0. These 1 and 0 are called bits. They can stay only in a single state that is either 1 or 0.

Using different combinations of transistors we can create many logic gates depending on the application of user.

# Question 3

- The green and blue values are all just random values in the range 0..255 ("snow")
- The data of the real image is exclusively in the red values
- In addition, the red values have all been divided by 10 (dark)
- The green/blue snow is obscuring the real image

Write code to recover the real image.

# Question 4

Write code to fix the stop-sky image which should show a red stop sign front with a background of a light blue sky and green tree leaves.

# Question 5

Write code to fix the puzzle-copper image. The red values in the image are random noise, so they should be set to 0.

The real image is in the blue and green values, which have been divide by 10.

# Question 6

Write code to fix the puzzle-iron image. The red and green values in the image are random noise, so they should be set to 0.

The real image is in the blue values, which have been divide by 10. The "solution" image will look blue, since it is exclusively in the blue values, so don't worry about that. We'll see a way to fix that blueness in a later section.
